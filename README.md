# My Awesome Pred-ject! 🚀
This project is designed to make your life... predictable! :smile:
You can anticipate your score based on your hour of learning using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), incorporate Feature Engineering, then create Machine Learning Regression Models, cool, huh! Even you can evaluate which model provides the most accurate predictions. ✨ Breathtaking..!✨

## 🎲 **Features**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering (duplicatedndling missing values and outlier analysis)
- ML Regression: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, dan Random Forest
- Model Evaluation: R-squared Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE)

## 🖥️ **Used**
- **Python**        :NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Scikit-Learn**  :ML Regression, Model Evaluation)
- **Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab**

## ⛓️ **Installation**
👬 Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/enshefalogram/ml-pred-test.git
```
🔃 Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
📊 Analyze data by running the Jupyter Notebook analysis and modeling.
